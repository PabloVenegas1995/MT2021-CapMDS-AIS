In this folder you find the implementation of the ILP model of the "minimum dominating set (MDS)" problem for CPLEX. The MDS problem is an NP-hard problem in undirected graphs. More specifically, given an undirected graph G=(V,E), each subset S of V is called a dominating set of G if each vertex v of V that does not form part of S has at least one neighbor u that forms part of S. The MDS problem requires to find a domating set S* of minimal size. 

Under Linux the software compiles by executing 'make' in a console. It requires that you have the GCC comiler installed on your machine.

However, before doing so you must install the CPLEX sources on your machine. For this purpose you should download the file 'CPLEX_Studio201.tgz' from the Google Drive folder 'CPLEX-Linux-Windows-Mac' and unpack it at some convenient place on your machine. In my case, for example, I have unpacked the CPLEX source file at '/home/cblum/ILOG/'. 

The last thing to be done before compiling the MDS software is changing the following 2 lines in the file 'Makefile' such that the paths point to the CPLEX sources on your machine:

CPLEXDIR      = /home/cblum/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio201/cplex
CONCERTDIR    = /home/cblum/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio201/concert

Executing 'make' generates an executable 'cplex_mds', which you can use in the following way:

./cplex_mds -i ./instances/<nombre-fichero> -t <tiempo-limite-en-segundos>

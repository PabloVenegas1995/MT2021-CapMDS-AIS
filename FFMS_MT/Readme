Under Linux the software compiles by executing 'make' in a console. It requires that you have the GCC comiler installed on your machine.

However, before doing so you must install the CPLEX sources on your machine. For this purpose you should download the file 'CPLEX_Studio201.tgz' from the Google Drive folder 'CPLEX-Linux-Windows-Mac' and unpack it at some convenient place on your machine. In my case, for example, I have unpacked the CPLEX source file at '/home/cblum/ILOG/'. 

The last thing to be done before compiling the software is changing the following 2 lines in the file 'Makefile' such that the paths point to the CPLEX sources on your machine:

CPLEXDIR      = /home/cblum/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio201/cplex
CONCERTDIR    = /home/cblum/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio201/concert

Executing 'make' generates five executables: 'greedy', 'cplex', 'local_search', 'metaheuristic', and 'hybrid_metaheuristic'. The 5 algorithms/techniques themselfs are not yet implemented. This is your task ;-)
